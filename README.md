generic_embedded
================

Generic embedded stuff used throughout hobby projects.

Comprised in here are drivers for processors, drivers for processor peripherals (e.g. SPI, UART, I2C), drivers
for chips I come across (e.g. sensors, transmitters, etc). 

Also contains kernel like stuff, e.g. task queue, preemptive scheduler, a.o.
